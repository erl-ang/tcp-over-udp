# tcp-over-udp
name, uni: Erin Liang, ell2147

A simplified version of the transmission control protocol (TCP) that operates over user datagram protocol (UDP) in order to provide reliable and ordered delivery of data packets between devices. To simulate a unreliable network, we use [newudpl from the Columbia Internet and Real Time Lab](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/research/projects/newudpl/newudpl-1.4/newudpl.html). 

Made for Professor Misra's Spring 2023 CSEE W4119 Computer Networks course at Columbia University. The [original spec can be found here](https://github.com/erl-ang/tcp-over-udp/blob/master/Programming%20Assignment%202.pdf).

## architecture overview üèòÔ∏è
At a very high level, TCP and UDP are protocols used in computer networks for communication between devices. While TCP ensures **reliable (i.e. in-order and complete) data delivery**, UDP does not provide the guarantee that packets will arrive in-order nor that a given packet will arrive at all.

We can learn more about TCP's reliability mechanisms by implementing such mechanisms (error checking, timeouts, retransmissions, flow control, etc) on top of UDP. It is impossible to test if the reliability mechanisms are working as intended when running both the sender and receiver programs locally, as the data packets will likely not be dropped nor corrupted.

</p>


Thus, we use newudpl, a network emulator written by Columbia University's Internet and Real Time Lab, as a proxy between the client and the server to test whether our bootleg TCP is working as expected. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/erl-ang/tcp-over-udp/blob/master/assets/proxy.png" style="width: 70%;"></p>

Note that in this assignment, ACKs were assumed to be reliable (i.e. ACKs do not go through `newudpl`), which is not a realistic assumption.

## how to run üèÉ
### installing, building, and running newudpl

If you cannot run the provided `newudpl` binary directly, build it from the provided `.tar` file:
```bash
tar -xf newudpl-1.7.tar
cd newudpl-1.7.tar
./configure
make
```

Example `newudpl` command (recreating diagram above):
- Running `newudpl` that listens for client‚Äôs messages on port 2222 and forwards messages to port 4444. Both the client and server program are run on the local machine. The probability of packets being dropped is 50%. Oof.
```bash
./newudpl -p 2222:3333 -i 127.0.0.1:1234 -o 127.0.0.1:4444 -vv -L50
```
- You can use `-p [receive port]:[send port]` to specify which port `newudpl` listens for udp packets from source host and from which port to send udp packets to destination host. The client will send packets to the `receive port`of `newudpl`

### running tcpclient.py üíª

To run the client, an example command is:

```bash
python3 tcpclient.py ./testfiles/screendump.txt 0.0.0.0  2222 1152 1234
```

- This will start running a tcpclient that transfers `screendump.txt` listening on port 1234 for ACKs. The tcpclient will forward all segments it needs to send to the server to `newudpl` (the proxy), which is listening on address (0.0.0.0, 2222). The tcp `windowsize` for pipelining segments is set to 1152.

Generically, the usage of `tcpclient` is:

```bash
usage: tcpclient.py [-h] file address_of_udpl port_number_of_udpl windowsize ack_port_number
```

- Note that the `windowsize` must be a multiple the MSS set in `utils.py`, but the program will yell at you if you don‚Äôt provide the correct arguments. The MSS can be adjusted in utils.py to test performance of smaller segments.
- I set MSS to 536 in my submission because [Wikipedia says that that‚Äôs the typical TCP MSS size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_segment_size#:~:text=%5Bedit%5D-,The%20default%20TCP%20Maximum%20Segment%20Size%20is%20536,-.%5B6%5D).

- Invoking the help options for the client:

```bash
$ python3 tcpclient.py -h
usage: tcpclient.py [-h] file address_of_udpl port_number_of_udpl windowsize ack_port_number

Bootleg TCP implementation over UDP

positional arguments:
  file                 file that client reads data from
  address_of_udpl      emulator's address
  port_number_of_udpl  emulator's port number
  windowsize           window size in bytes
  ack_port_number      port number for ACKs

optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
```

### running `tcpserver.py`  üíª

To run the server, an example command is:

```bash
python3 tcpserver.py ./testfiles/screendump.txt  4444 127.0.0.1 1234
```

- This will start running a tcpserver listening on port 4444 locally. It will receive `screendump.txt` and acknowledge receipt of tcp segments by sending ACKs to the client‚Äôs address (port 1234 locally)

Generically, the usage of `tcpserver` is:
 - note that (address_for_acks, port_for_acks) is the client‚Äôs address. 

```bash
usage: python3 tcpserver.py [-h] file listening_port address_for_acks port_for_acks
```

- Invoking the help options for the server:

```bash
$ python3 tcpserver.py -h
usage: tcpserver.py [-h] file listening_port address_for_acks port_for_acks

Bootleg TCP implementation over UDP

positional arguments:
  file              file to send over TCP
  listening_port    port to listen on
  address_for_acks  address to send ACKs to
  port_for_acks     port to send ACKs to

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
```

## Features
The code works as it is and as the assignment spec specifies. Specifically, it implements:

- Connection establishment via the three-way handshake
- Reliable transmission of a file
- Connection teardown via sending a FIN (where either the client and server can initiate)
- Retransmission timer adjustment
- Logging

You can adjust some of the TCP variables set in `utils.py` to test what yields the best performance. These variables are:

- `MSS`, the maximum amount of data that can be carried in a single TCP segment.
- `MAX_RETRIES` , the maximum amount of retries the programs try to send a segment before initiating the connection teardown sequence (i.e. sending a FIN to to the client/server)
- the retransmission and timeout constants: `INITIAL_TIMEOUT`, `ALPHA`, `BETA`, `TIME_WAIT`,and `TIMEOUT_MULTIPLIER`. These values are discussed in the design doc

Note that adjusting these variables comes at your own risk. No matter what, the connection is guaranteed to terminate gracefully (but not always efficiently). For example, if MAX_RETRIES is too low and there is significant packet loss, the client will probably hit the threshold for retransmissions, only send over a portion of the data, and send a FIN to terminate the connection. This is reasonable behavior because a client should probably wait for the network conditions to get better before trying to transmit a file.


## normal program run
*A description of a successful file transfer between the client and the server. Other cases are discussed later in this document*

After successfully running udpl, tcpserver, and tcpclient, the following will occur...
- three way handshake
- data transfer
- connection teardown
- with retransmission timers being set in between!

### TCPClient Walkthrough

#### Three way handshake
- The client will initiate the three-way handshake. It will send SYN segments until the server responds with a SYNACK.
- The client will send an ACK back to complete the three-way handshake sequence. This ACK will have some data piggybacked on it‚Äî the filesize of the file being transferred.
- At this point, the three-way handshake is finished in the client‚Äôs POV, but the ‚Äú=====connection established======‚Äù message doesn‚Äôt print until the server ACKs this back, as the client‚Äôs ACK could have been lost.

#### Data transmission
The client will then start sending data. Go-Back-N pipelining is used so not every data segment needs to be ACK‚Äôd before another is sent. To do this:
- The client creates a window (which holds all the segments that are sent but not ACK‚Äôd) fill it up with tcp segments with (MSS 20) bytes of the file data as the segments‚Äô payload. After receiving an ACK for a segment in the window, it will move the window‚Äôs indices forward and send the next data from the file.
- On 3 duplicate ACKs, the client will retransmit the first segment in the window
- If a timeout occurs, all the segments in the window are resent.

After the client reaches the end of the file, we can‚Äôt return yet because the data might not have been received. Instead, wait until the server sends a FIN to indicate that the file is finished being received.

#### Connection teardown
Upon receiving a FIN, the client will:
- respond with an ACK (which may get lost. See code for comment on this)
- send its own FIN and retransmit if there‚Äôs a timeout
- receive an ACK and send nothing, exiting.

This entire time, the timeout values will be adjusted according to $SampleRTTs$ and timeout adjustments as discussed in RFC 6298. This is also discussed later in this document.

### TCPServer Walkthrough

#### Three-way handshake
- The server will wait and listen for a SYN segment. To avoid listening forever and having a half open-connection, it will try `MAX_RETRIES` amount of times, setting the timeout interval accordingly.
- If it receives one, it will respond with a SYNACK and wait until the client sends its final ACK to complete the connection. This ACK will contain the filesize.


#### Data transmission
- Because the server needs to acknowledge that it has received data (filesize), it will send an ACK back, indicating to the client that it is ready to receive the file.
- The server will start to receive the file from the client. It keeps track of the next in-order sequence number. When it receives a segment, it checks whether the segment has this sequence number. If so, it writes the data to the output file. Out of order segments are discarded. In both cases, an ACK is sent with the next sequence number that the server expects. When the segment is out of order, this ACK will be a duplicate.
- The server will receive data until it receives the amount of bytes specified by the payload in the last leg of the handshake or if the client sends a FIN request.

#### Connection teardown
The server will send a FIN request, indicating that it is done reading the file. Then, the server will:
- wait until it receives a FINACK from the client
- after receiving the FINACK from the client, it will wait for the client‚Äôs FIN segment and send its own FINACK.
- wait TIME_WAIT seconds after sending the FINACK and exit.

## how it works
### Establishing a connection ü§ù

The conceptual details of this section are taken from pg 249 of K&R. As TCP is connection-oriented, the two processes that are trying to communicate with each other must first set up a connection with each other via a procedure called the three-way handshake. This connection-establishment procedure is as follows:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/erl-ang/tcp-over-udp/blob/master/assets/connection-est.png">
</p>

1. The client process initiates by first sending a SYN with a random `client_isn` in the seq_num in the segment to the server.
2. After receiving the SYN (there is a possibility this doesn‚Äôt happen), the server will respond with SYNACK segment to indicate that it has agreed to establish this connection. This SYNACK has `client_isn+1` in the header‚Äôs ack field, and puts its own initial random sequence number `server_isn` in the seq num.
3. After the client has received the SYNACK segment, the client will send a final segment to complete the connection-establishment procedure. This final ACK segment is piggybacked on 4 bytes of data containing the file‚Äôs size.

This is the exchange if all goes well. But what happens if the SYN segment does not arrive?

#### packet loss during a three-way handshake
*packet loss can occur during connection establishment so the following design decisions were made to avoid a half-open connection for a prolonged period of time.*

Losing SYN packet: 
- Following [this Ed thread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/36439/discussion/2979548), the client will try sending the SYN segment MAX_RETRIES amount of times until it receives an SYNACK with the client_isn+1, resetting the timeout according to the tcp standard. It will also attempt to measure a SampleRTT if this SYN segment is not retransmitted.
- If the client doesn‚Äôt receive that SYNACK within MAX_RETRIES transmissions, it will just abort the connection.
- The server will be listening for the SYN until it times out MAX_RETRIES times (multiplying the timeout every time), until it also aborts the connection.

Losing the client‚Äôs final ACK
- See the comment in `establish_connection`. The client will send an ACK segment with the file size piggybacked to the server and wait for an ACK from the server before officially sending file data. This ACK is treated like all other segments (retransmitted until it hits the limit). If the ACK is not ACk‚Äôd back within the retransmission limit, the client will send a FIN and the server will respond.
- This mechanism is to prevent a half-open connection if the last ACK of the three-way handshake gets lost. While the server will timeout waiting for its SYNACK to be ACK'd, the client will think that the connection is established and start sending data. By waiting for an additional ACK, we can ensure that the connection is fully established before sending file data.
- The tradeoff is just a longer connection establishment time. This is implemented in `SimplexTCPClient._send_ack_with_filesize`

### Data transmission and reception

#### Data transmission üöÄ

The file is divided in (file size in bytes)/(MSS in bytes) number of segments, with each segment being of size $MSS$. Data transmission and reception is implemented in `SimplexTCPClient.send_file_gbn` and `SimplexTCPServer.receive_file_gbn`

The client will read MSS data from the file to break it into packets and send out (windowsize // MSS) packets. We keep track of the window‚Äôs packets and how many retries the packet has taken with a list of tuples to take valid $SampleRTT$ measurements.

```
# window format:
[(segment, num_retries), ...]
```
    
- `send_base` and `next_seq_num` keep track of the window‚Äôs indices:
 
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/erl-ang/tcp-over-udp/blob/master/assets/gbn-view.png">
</p>

One segment from the window will be chosen to measure a $SampleRTT$ for so we can update the timeout values. If the segment has been retransmitted, we discard the $SampleRTT$ and just have to live with the fact that we won‚Äôt have a $SampleRTT$ for this RTT.

Once the client has filled up its window, the client will try receiving acks, verifying if the ack for a segment that is currently in the window. If it is, we can move the window forward by removing the segment from the window and updating the `send_base`.

To account for lost packets, if the client does not receive a valid ack in time, it will timeout and retransmit all the segments in the window, incrementing the number of retransmissions that the segments have taken.

If a segment has been retransmitted too many times, it will begin the connection teardown sequence by sending a FIN to the server.

Fast retransmit
- If it has received a triple duplicate ack, it will perform a fast retransmit and send the first segment in the window as the packet was probably lost
- Especially when window sizes get bigger and `newudpl` gets more packet loss, it can take a while for retransmissions to occur, so fast retransmit is useful.

#### Data reception üëê

All the data that the client sends will be written to a file called `recvd_file` with no extensions so users can easily `diff` it with the original file. Data reception is implemented in `SimplexTCPServer.receive_file_gbn`.
The receiver will keep track of two state variables:
- the next expected sequence number to receive next, denoted by `next_seq_num`.
- the number of `bytes_received` so far from the client. This is used so the server can detect when we‚Äôre done transmitting. Recall that the client sends the size of the file to the server as part of the last third of the three-way handshake, so the server can just compare `bytes_received` with the filesize.

The server will open a new file called `recvd_file` for writing and try receiving data from the client, updating the timeout accordingly.

If the server receives something, the received segment can:
- be out of order or corrupted ‚Äî> the packet is discarded and a duplicate ack is sent (ack with the last in-order packet correctly received)
- have the correct expected sequence number, in which case the ack for `next_seq_num` is sent and `next_seq_num` is incremented to denote that we received it (again, it‚Äôs the ack with the last in-order packet correctly received)

Terminating data reception
- the server will either keep trying to receive data ‚Äúinfinitely‚Äù until it has received the `filesize` bytes. Then, it will send a FIN to the client.
- or can terminate prematurely if the server has hit its retransmission limit (in which case it will begin the `_respond_to_fin()` sequence). Thus, there is a check in `receive_file_gbn` to check if the server received a FIN segment.

Note that the `seq_nums` of the TCPServer and the ack_nums of the TCPClient don‚Äôt have to be used because we‚Äôre using a GBN policy!

### Ending a connection (FIN request) üèÅ

Both the server and the client are able to initiate the teardown sequence. This is implemented in both file‚Äôs `send_fin()`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/erl-ang/tcp-over-udp/blob/master/assets/teardown.png">
</p>

The client will initiate the closing of a TCP connection when a segment hits its retransmission limit.

This can happen while sending file data or during the last ACK of the three way handshake. This sequence depicted by the diagram below (from K&R textbook) will be kicked off.
- The client will send a FIN (which can get lost). If the FIN segment hits the retransmission limit, there is nothing that the client can really do, so it just aborts and exits.
- If the server successfully receives the FIN, it will respond with a FINACK and then a FIN. After this point, the server can try to receive the ack (which it does try, but only once), but it can safely ignore this ACK and wait TIME_WAIT seconds before closing the connection. This is safe because the server‚Äôs FIN is guaranteed to arrive at the client so the client will begin the timed wait and close its side, resulting in both sides closed. This is implemented in `respond_to_fin()`

The server will initiate the closing of a TCP connection when it has received the entire file from the client. This will kick off the same sequence as above, with the server and client‚Äôs roles reversed.
- The server will send a FIN to the client.
- The client will respond with a FINACK, which can get lost. The client will also respond with a FIN, which can also get lost.
    - Because the client‚Äôs FIN is what really kicks off the closing sequence for the client, we only try retransmitting the client‚Äôs FIN segment MAX_RETRIES amount of times (and not the first FINACK). Technically, it should close the connection as soon as the client sends the FIN, but we make our best effort in telling the server that the client is also shutting down. This is implemented in `respond_to_fin()`

To test this functionality:
- test client initiation of connection termination by setting the MAX_RETRIES super low
- test server initiation by making the file transmitted super small so the server will send the FIN.
- In my tests, there were a lot of times where the file was finished being received but some leftover in-flight packets were being received during the server shutdown sequence. In any case, it terminates gracefully.

### Error logging ‚ö†Ô∏è

Python‚Äôs `logging` module is used to record timeouts, duplicate acks, retransmissions, and connection teardown/setup states so there are timestamps recorded with everything. The logging levels can be adjusted per the README.txt, but it is pasted here for convenience:

To get **more** verbose logging, you can set `LOGGING_LEVEL` in `utils.py` to `logging.DEBUG`. This may come at the expense of performance if the file is large and especially because the logs are being written to multiple streams.

To get **less** verbose logging, you can set LOGGING_LEVEL to `logging.INFO` , `logging.WARNING`, `logging.ERROR`, etc. Higher levels will include all the logs from the levels below. For example, INFO will include all the logging.error logs. See the documentation for Python‚Äôs logging module for more details.

| Level    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DEBUG    | Lots of information: every packet and its `ack_num`, `seq_num`, payload, and flags; when a new sample RTT is measured / discarded when the packet being measured is a retransmission; window moving forward and which segment is being removed from it; the expected `ack_num` when a duplicate ack is received, etc. |
| INFO     | Timeout updates, states for connection teardown and establishment (e.g., `CLOSE_WAIT`, `SYN_SENT`, etc.), file transfer messages, out of order segments, etc.                                                                 |
| WARNING  | Maximum retransmissions reached ‚Äî> beginning to terminate program, handling unexpected exceptions (haven't seen this one be invoked yet)                                                                                       |
| ERROR    | Checksum verification failures, unexpected flags in received segments, incorrect `ack` numbers during the handshake sequence, invalid arguments, etc.                                                                             |

- For convenience, logs are written to `tcpclient.log` , `tcpserver.log` , as well as `stdout`

### 20-byte TCP header format  üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The format of the TCP headers attached to the payload follows figure 3.29 from the textbook. There aren‚Äôt many design decisions we can make here.


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/erl-ang/tcp-over-udp/blob/master/assets/tcp-seg-structure.png">
</p>


The 20-byte TCP header a python bytearray, which we extend to add the payload.

The header is created in `_make_tcp_header_without_checksum` in utils, as we cannot compute the checksum without the segment‚Äôs payload (if it has a payload).

There are some fields that are not used in this program (CWR, ECE, RST, urgent data pointer, options), so the header looks more like:

### Retransmission timer adjustment as per TCP standard ‚è≥‚åõ

Figuring out how long the timeout should be before a segment gets retransmitted is tough; it must be larger than the RTT, otherwise there would be too many retransmissions. But it can‚Äôt be too large, otherwise lost packets will not be quickly retransmitted.

The following statements document some design choices concerning the retransmission timer.

A maximum retransmission limit of 7 (can be tweaked in `utils`) was set because typical TCP implementations have a `MAX_RETRIES` of 5-7

The socket timeouts are set via the below formula taken from the textbook. These implementations can be found in the tcpclient and tcpserver‚Äôs `update_timeout_rtt`
    
    - $$ TimeoutInterval = EstimatedRTT + 4DevRTT $$
    
    - where EstimatedRTT and DevRTT are measures of the ‚Äúaverage sampleRTT‚Äù and ‚Äú variability of the RTT‚Äù given by these formulas from RFC 6298:  
    - $$ EstimatedRTT = 0.875Estimated RTT + 0.125SampleRTT $$   
    - $$ DevRTT = 0.75DevRTT + 0.25|SampleRTT - EstimatedRTT|$$  
    - the `EstimatedRTT` formula is a weighted combination of the previous value of `EstimatedRTT` and `SampleRTT` from RFC 6298. The motivation behind using an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù is that `SampleRTT`s vary a lot with network congestion and fluctuations:

Having a timer per unACK‚Äôd packet would be too hefty for the program (there can be lots of in-flight packets). Like most other TCP implementations, the SimplexTCPClient only takes a `SampleRTT` measurement for only one of the transmitted but UNACK‚Äôd segments. This is because we only really need a new value of $SampleRTT$ per RTT, it is unnecessary and slows down things if we take any more measurements.

The client does not compute $SampleRTT$ for retransmissions, as the client cannot distinguish between an ACK for the original segment vs an ACK for a retransmitted segment (see HW3). Measuring RTTs for retransmissions could cause a huge dip in the $SampleRTT$ and lead to even faster transmissions, jamming the network more.
- This is implemented by keeping track of how many times a packet has had to be retransmitted in the window.
- when there‚Äôs a lot of loss (e.g. L50), it takes a longer time to send as expected because the SampleRTTs aren‚Äôt updating on a per-RTT basis since there‚Äôs more retransmissions.

Per RFC 6298, the initial $timeoutInterval$ value is set to 1 second. Upon receipt of the first valid ACK, the EstimatedRTT is initialized to $SampleRTT$, and $DevRTT=0.5*SampleRTT$.
- We try to measure valid ACKs in the connection setup sequence, but there is a chance that these segments also had to be retransmitted.

I chose to not do any adjusting for the $SampleRTT$ in the FIN sequence, as the connection is shutting down.

Note that the server cannot measure as many $SampleRTTs$ as the client, as it does not send data and wait for ACKs often. It only waits for a segment‚Äôs ACK during connection setup and teardown, but I chose to only attempt to measure a $SampleRTT$ during connection setup as having an accurate timeout value during teardown is not of the highest priority. If this $SampleRTT$ was not representative of the actual average RTT of the server ‚Üí receiver link, this decision could cause lots of timeouts.

### Correct computation of the TCP checksum ‚úÖ

The checksum is calculated in `calculate_checksum` and attached to the segment in`make_tcp_segment`

The process is as follows:
- make sure the segment‚Äôs length is even. if not, pad a 0-byte.
- set the checksum field to 0
- sum all the 16-bit words in the segment (header and data with the checksum field set to 0)
- take the 1st complement of this sum and wrap the overflow around

## Design Decisions Summary üé®

### Using GBN instead of SR üìä

When resending segments after a timeout, the client uses a Go-Back-N policy. It sends all segments in the window.

This is as opposed to using a Selective Repeat, where the receiver individually acknowledges correctly received packets, so correctly received OOO packets will be buffered.

Pros of using GBN
- it simplifies receiver design a lot by removing receiver buffering altogether, so it the server only needs to know about `next_seq_num`. The code for this project was already super bulky so even though buffering OOO segments is the practical approach, I chose GBN for ease of implementation.
- Also means that the seq_nums of the TCPServer and the ack_nums of the TCPClient don‚Äôt have to be used! This made debugging a lot easier.

Cons of using GBN
- We throw away a correctly received packet, and a subsequent retransmission of that packet might be lost. This could cause more retransmissions.
- For large window sizes and large packet loss, GBN is not great. A single packet error can cause GBN to retransmit all the packets in the window (unnecessarily for a lot of the packets), so the file transfer can terminate before the entire file is received, since the client hits the retransmission limit. Or, the file transfer just takes a really really long time to complete.

### Retransmission timer adjustment ‚è∞

The timeout multiplier (what is multiplied to the `timeoutInterval` after a timeout) is set to 1.1 instead of the recommended doubling of the timeout.

Otherwise, the timeout increases too quickly and the file transfer will take a really long time (especially if there are a lot of retransmissions and the SampleRTTs aren‚Äôt also adjusting the timeout intervals).

### TIME_WAIT ‚åö

After receiving a FIN, the server/client will wait for 5 seconds before terminating, which is a lot shorter than what the textbook says (30 seconds). This made it easier for testing.

## additional features
verbose logging and arg checking, which are boring to discuss. here's something more interesting.

### congestion control: fast retransmit üöÑ

When window sizes get bigger and `newudpl` has a lot of packet loss, lots of duplicate ACKs are sent and it can take a while for packets to be retransmitted since the client has to wait for the timer to expire.

To try to detect packet losses earlier, I implemented a basic version of [fast retransmit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCP_congestion_control). Upon receipt of 3 duplicate ACKs, we resend the first segment in the window, as it was probably lost.

The implementation is in `SimplexTCPClient.send_file_gbn()`:
    
```
# Part of fast Retransmit. If we receive 3 duplicate ACKs, then resend the segment
# with the lowest sequence number in the window.
if num_dup_acks == 3:
  logger.info(
    "Received 3 duplicate ACKs. Resending segment with seq_num {send_base}"
  )
  segment, num_retries = window[0]
  window[0] = (segment, 0)
  self.socket.sendto(segment, self.proxy_address)
  num_dup_acks = 0
```
    
# Testing Environment üß™

This program works for my 2020 Mac (Intel) running Python 3.9.13, so it should work for Linux environments. I‚Äôm on macOS Big Sur v11.76.
